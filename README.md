# Data-Structures-And-Algorithms-I
For people with all kinds of programming levels. You can learn and/or review how pointers and basic data structures work. In addition, it will also help you to improve your programming logic.

Basic, simple and documented-in-code implementations of the following data structures will be covered:
- Array
- Singly linked list (another linked lists will remain as an exercise for the programmer since they start from the same idea, changing their implementation minimally)
- Stack
- Queue
- Set
- Tree
- Graph

Some of the algorithms that will be covered:
- Linear search
- Binary search
- Quick sort
- Bubble sort
- Depth search (DFS)
- Breadth search (BFS)
- Dijkstra's algorithm

I hope it helps! <3
